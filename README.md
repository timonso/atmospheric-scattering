# Atmospheric Scattering Shader (macOS)

This application simulates the way sunlight is being scattered by planetary atmospheres such as that of the earth.
It is based on the numerical approximation of Rayleigh and Mie scattering presented [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems2/part-ii-shading-lighting-and-shadows/chapter-16-accurate-atmospheric-scattering) by Sean O'Neill in NVIDIA GPU Gems.

Read more about the implementation in this [report](https://github.com/timonso/atmospheric-scattering/blob/main/report.pdf).
